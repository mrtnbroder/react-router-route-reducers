Add reducer to your routes and let them be composed and combined into a single state object that follows your route-structure.

## Installation

Install the lib with:

```sh
$ npm i -S react-router-route-reducers
```

and make sure to have the latest versions of `redux`, `react-router`, `react-redux` and `react` installed.

```sh
$ npm i -S react@next react-router redux react-redux
```

## Usage

Add a reducer to your route:

```jsx
<Route path='/' reducer={rootReducer}>
  <IndexRoute reducer={indexReducer}/>
  <Route path='dashboard' reducer={dashboardReducer}>
</Route>
```

or as plain routes (recommended):

```js
{
  path: '/',
  reducer: rootReducer,
  indexRoute: {
    reducer: indexReducer
  },
  childRoutes: [
    {
      path: 'dashboard',
      reducer: dashboardReducer
    }
  ]
}
```

Pass the RoutesReducer to the render function of ReactRouter

```jsx
import RoutesReducer from 'react-router-route-reducers'
...

const store = configureStore(reducers, __INITAL_STATE__)
// No need to wrap React-Router in <Provider/>, it will be handled inside <RoutesReducer/>
<Router render={onRender(store)}>
  {routes}
</Router>
}

const onRender = (store) => (props) => (
  <RoutesReducer
    reducers={reducers} // all other global reducers
    store={store} // pass the redux store here
    {...props}
    />
)
```

Your reducers will then be composed into the following structure:

```js
{
  'route-reducers': {
    self: rootReducer,
    child: {
      self: indexReducer,
      child: {
        self: dashboardReducer,
        child: null
      }
    }
  }
}
```

..and your data will be passed as `{ model }` to your component:

```jsx
export const view = ({ model, dispatch, ...props }) => (
  <div {...props}>
    <h2>{model.data}</h2>
  </div>
)
```

## Rationale

Coming soon...

## API

### `<RoutesReducer>`

Primary component of react-router-route-reducers. It combines your routes-reducers into a single object based on your route structure.

#### Props

##### `store` (required)

The Redux store instance.

##### `reducers`

All other global reducers.
